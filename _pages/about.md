Hey :)

I am currently a third-year bachelor-straight-to-PhD student in the [Pervasive Computing Lab](http://percom.zju.edu.cn/) at [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof.Ling Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/lc). My research aims to enable wearable devices to sense, understand, model, and influence our longitudinal daily behavior to improve health and well-being.
